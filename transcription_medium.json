If you said I went back and I got my high school diploma, I'm going to look at you a certain way, 'cause you went back and finished what you started. Right, but if you went got your GED, what we'll see is someone who went back and got finished what they started, but finished in a different way. Yeah, right. One does not look worse to at least to me."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Speaker B",
    "text": "Like they say, they say, oh, they're equivalent or whatever, but I feel like one looks better than the other. Maybe. People, yeah, possibly. I don't know. I just as long as I can get it. I really don't care. I just need a high school diploma because that's the gateway to success."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Speaker A",

    "speaker": "Speaker B",
    "text": "All right, so I want to get a trade. I want to get a few trades. Actually, that's my goal. I want to get like three or four different trades. Okay, so that way no matter what, always that one looks like there's always some, always got work. Yeah."

    "speaker": "Speaker A",
    "text": "All right. So how far do you think you are away from actually being able to get that high school diploma? What do you think honestly?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Speaker B",
    "text": "I? Don't think that far because I don't know if you know what Literacy Alliance is. It's a like GD high school program, whatever here in Jacksonville, and I went there and took the test for both of the things you have to have required to take the GD test. I passed both of them. So, okay. So not far. Yeah, not far, but I'm letting say I'm ready."
